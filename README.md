The data contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics/attributes like areas, no. of bathrooms,  etc. At times, the property dealers appreciate the prices based on the demand and hence there is rise in the prices in real estate. So, in order to cope with this problem so that it is beneficial for customers, we must have a model in place which should tell us the ideal prices of the houses based on its characteristics.
The objective of this project is to predict the ideal prices of the houses based on their characteristics using a regression algorithm.
